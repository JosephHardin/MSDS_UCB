# MSDS_UCB
The purpose of this repository is to organize files needed and created in my pursuit of a Masters of Science in Data Science from the University of Colorado - Boulder -- hence (MSDS_UCB)
There will be many instances of original work, however there will also be direct copies of others code/presentations/papers.  I will make clear at the top of each item if it is mine or not
If there are any questions feel free to email me at Joe.Hardin369@gmail.com
